# 1. Treat all web-related files as documentation/vendored 
# This removes them from the language statistics calculation entirely
*.html linguist-vendored
*.css linguist-vendored
*.js linguist-vendored

# 2. Ensure Java is explicitly detected and prioritized
*.java linguist-detectable=true

# 3. If you have specific folders for templates, ignore them specifically
src/main/resources/templates/** linguist-vendored
src/main/resources/static/** linguist-vendored
